## Introduction

Term Deposit Prediction is an important use case in the banking industry. Term deposits represent a significant source of income for banks, and efficient targeting of potential customers for term deposits is vital to optimize marketing efforts. This project focuses on utilizing data from direct marketing campaigns to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, enabling the bank to target the right audience and reduce costs associated with telephonic marketing campaigns.

## Key Features

- Analyze bank marketing campaign data to identify patterns and insights.
- Use predictive modeling techniques to forecast customer behavior.
- Optimize targeting strategies for telephonic marketing campaigns.
- Improve marketing efficiency and reduce unnecessary expenses.

## Dataset

The dataset is derived from the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The data includes client details, campaign information, and the final outcome (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit).

### **Dataset Files**

- **train.csv**: Contains 40,000 rows and 17 columns, including the target variable `y`.
- **test.csv**: Contains 5,211 rows and 16 columns, excluding the target variable `y`.
